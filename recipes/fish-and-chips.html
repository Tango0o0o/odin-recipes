        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A traditional British dish served all over the world, fish and chips 
            consist of crispy, golden-battered fish fillets paired with thick-cut, 
            deep-fried potato chips. This classic comfort food is often accompanied 
            by a sprinkle of salt and a dash of malt vinegar, with optional sides 
            such as mushy peas, tartar sauce, or a wedge of lemon. Celebrated for 
            its satisfying crunch and savory flavors, fish and chips embody the 
            essence of British culinary heritage, delighting diners with every bite 
            from quaint seaside towns to bustling urban eateries.

            <li><h3>For the chips</h3></li> <!--Heading to differentiate which ingredients are specific for which part of the dish-->

            <li>2 large Maris Piper potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp malt vinegar, plus extra to serve</li>

            <li><h3>For the batter</h3></li>

            <li>5g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>25g cornflour</li>
            <li>small pinch of ground turmeric</li>
            <li>125g cold lager or fizzy water</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>
                Cut the potatoes into chips and soak in cold water for 5 mins, 
                then wash until the water runs clear. Tip into a pan of cold water 
                with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp malt vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then 
                turn down the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 mins until cooked 
                through but not falling apart. Drain gently, then place on a tray 
                in a single layer and chill until needed. Can be prepared a day 
                ahead.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                When you’re ready to fry, prepare the batter. Tip the flours and 
                turmeric into a bowl with a pinch of salt, pour over the beer or 
                fizzy water, and mix quickly until everything just comes together 
                to the consistency of double cream – do not over-beat, a few lumps
                are fine. Keep chilled.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour the oil into a deep, wide pan like a wok, or heat a deep-fat 
                fryer to 180C. If using a pan or wok, ensure that it is no more than 
                two-thirds full with oil. Heat the oil until it is shimmering and 
                carefully lower in the chips using a slotted spoon. Fry for 8-10 mins,
                gently stirring occasionally until golden and crisp. Transfer to 
                kitchen paper to drain.
            </li>

            <li>
                Put a little flour in a dish, then bring the oil you used to cook 
                the chips up to 185C, if you have a thermometer, or until a drizzle 
                of batter sizzles and crisps in less than a minute. Working quickly, 
                dust the fish in flour, then dredge through the batter. Hold the 
                fillet above the batter to let the excess drip back into the bowl, 
                then carefully lower into the oil. Fry the fillets for a minute 
                until the batter is just starting to set, then take a spoon and 
                drizzle the fillets with extra batter to create an even crunchier, 
                wispy coating. Fry the fish for about 4 mins, turning once, until 
                deep golden and crisp. Lift onto some kitchen paper to drain for a 
                minute, then serve with the chips. Also serve with salt and vinegar 
                if preferred.
