        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>
                Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip the rice in a sieve, 
                rinse under cold water, drain and set aside. Put the peppers, 
                onion, garlic, ginger and chilli, if using, in a food processor 
                and blitz until chopped.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Heat the oil in an ovenproof casserole over a medium heat and 
                fry the tomato purée for 2-3 mins, stirring often. Add the blitzed 
                pepper mixture and fry for 5 mins more, then add the herbs, spices 
                and 1 tsp salt. Fry for a further 1-2 mins, then stir in the rice to 
                coat. Pour in the stock, stir, cover and bake for 45 mins until the 
                rice is tender.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour the oil into a deep, wide pan like a wok, or heat a deep-fat 
                fryer to 180C. If using a pan or wok, ensure that it is no more than 
                two-thirds full with oil. Heat the oil until it is shimmering and 
                carefully lower in the chips using a slotted spoon. Fry for 8-10 mins,
                gently stirring occasionally until golden and crisp. Transfer to 
                kitchen paper to drain.
