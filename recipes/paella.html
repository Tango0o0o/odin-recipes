        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>  
            Paella is a celebrated Spanish dish that epitomizes the rich 
            culinary traditions of Valencia and the Mediterranean coast. 
            This colorful and aromatic creation features saffron-infused 
            rice cooked to perfection, mingling with an array of fresh 
            ingredients such as succulent seafood, tender chicken, and 
            savory chorizo. Enhanced with a vibrant mix of vegetables 
            like bell peppers, peas, and tomatoes, paella is traditionally 
            prepared in a large, shallow pan, allowing the flavors to meld 
            beautifully and the rice to develop a delightful crust known as 
            "socarrat" at the bottom. <b>Often garnished with lemon wedges and 
            fresh herbs</b>, paella offers a symphony of textures and tastes that 
            transport diners to the sun-drenched landscapes of Spain. Whether 
            enjoyed at a festive gathering or a leisurely meal, paella stands 
            as a testament to Spain’s culinary artistry and communal spirit.

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol class="steps">

            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or wok. 
                Add the onion and soften for 5 mins.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Add the smoked paprika, thyme and paella rice, stir for 1 min, 
                then splash in the sherry, if using. Once evaporated, stir in 
                the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock.
            </li>

            <li>
                Season and cook, uncovered, for about 15 mins, stirring now 
                and again until the rice is almost tender and still surrounded 
                with some liquid.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in the seafood mix and cover with a lid. Simmer for 5 mins, 
                or until the seafood is cooked through and the rice is tender. 
                Squeeze over the lemon juice, scatter over the parsley and 
                serve with the lemon wedges.
